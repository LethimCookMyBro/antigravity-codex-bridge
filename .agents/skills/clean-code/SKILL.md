# Clean Code - Pragmatic AI Coding Standards

Summary: Pragmatic coding standards - concise, direct, no over-engineering, no unnecessary comments.
Does NOT cover unapproved live-target actions, unauthorized access, or unverified assumptions.
## WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL

- Use when the task clearly matches `clean-code` or the folder's specialized domain
- Use when Codex should follow a repeatable workflow instead of ad-hoc reasoning
- Use when the output should separate scope, evidence, findings, and next actions


> **CRITICAL SKILL** - Be **concise, direct, and solution-focused**.

---

## Core Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **SRP** | Single Responsibility - each function/class does ONE thing |
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself - extract duplicates, reuse |
| **KISS** | Keep It Simple - simplest solution that works |
| **YAGNI** | You Aren't Gonna Need It - don't build unused features |
| **Boy Scout** | Leave code cleaner than you found it |

---

## Naming Rules

| Element | Convention |
|---------|------------|
| **Variables** | Reveal intent: `userCount` not `n` |
| **Functions** | Verb + noun: `getUserById()` not `user()` |
| **Booleans** | Question form: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit` |
| **Constants** | SCREAMING_SNAKE: `MAX_RETRY_COUNT` |

> **Rule:** If you need a comment to explain a name, rename it.

---

## Function Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Small** | Max 20 lines, ideally 5-10 |
| **One Thing** | Does one thing, does it well |
| **One Level** | One level of abstraction per function |
| **Few Args** | Max 3 arguments, prefer 0-2 |
| **No Side Effects** | Don't mutate inputs unexpectedly |

---

## Code Structure

| Pattern | Apply |
|---------|-------|
| **Guard Clauses** | Early returns for edge cases |
| **Flat > Nested** | Avoid deep nesting (max 2 levels) |
| **Composition** | Small functions composed together |
| **Colocation** | Keep related code close |

---

## AI Coding Style

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User asks for feature | Write it directly |
| User reports bug | Fix it, don't explain |
| No clear requirement | Ask, don't assume |

---

## Anti-Patterns (DON'T)

| ❌ Pattern | ✅ Fix |
|-----------|-------|
| Comment every line | Delete obvious comments |
| Helper for one-liner | Inline the code |
| Factory for 2 objects | Direct instantiation |
| utils.ts with 1 function | Put code where used |
| "First we import..." | Just write code |
| Deep nesting | Guard clauses |
| Magic numbers | Named constants |
| God functions | Split by responsibility |

---

## 🔴 Before Editing ANY File (THINK FIRST!)

**Before changing a file, ask yourself:**

| Question | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **What imports this file?** | They might break |
| **What does this file import?** | Interface changes |
| **What tests cover this?** | Tests might fail |
| **Is this a shared component?** | Multiple places affected |

**Quick Check:**
```
File to edit: UserService.ts
└── Who imports this? → UserController.ts, AuthController.ts
└── Do they need changes too? → Check function signatures
```

> 🔴 **Rule:** Edit the file + all dependent files in the SAME task.
> 🔴 **Never leave broken imports or missing updates.**

---

## Summary

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write code directly | Write tutorials |
| Let code self-document | Add obvious comments |
| Fix bugs immediately | Explain the fix first |
| Inline small things | Create unnecessary files |
| Name things clearly | Use abbreviations |
| Keep functions small | Write 100+ line functions |

> **Remember: The user wants working code, not a programming lesson.**

---

## 🔴 Self-Check Before Completing (MANDATORY)

**Before saying "task complete", verify:**

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| ✅ **Goal met?** | Did I do exactly what user asked? |
| ✅ **Files edited?** | Did I modify all necessary files? |
| ✅ **Code works?** | Did I test/verify the change? |
| ✅ **No errors?** | Lint and TypeScript pass? |
| ✅ **Nothing forgotten?** | Any edge cases missed? |

> 🔴 **Rule:** If ANY check fails, fix it before completing.

---

## Verification Scripts (MANDATORY)

> 🔴 **CRITICAL:** Each agent runs ONLY their own skill's scripts after completing work.

### Agent → Script Mapping

| Agent | Script | Command |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **frontend-specialist** | UX Audit | `python .agents/skills/frontend-design/scripts/ux_audit.py .` |

| **backend-specialist** | API Validator | `python .agents/skills/api-patterns/scripts/api_validator.py .` |
| **mobile-developer** | Mobile Audit | `python .agents/skills/mobile-design/scripts/mobile_audit.py .` |

| **Any agent** | i18n Check | `python .agents/skills/i18n-localization/scripts/i18n_checker.py .` |

> ❌ **WRONG:** `test-engineer` running `ux_audit.py`
> ✅ **CORRECT:** `frontend-specialist` running `ux_audit.py`

### 🔴 Script Output Handling (READ → SUMMARIZE → ASK)

**When running a validation script, you MUST:**

1. **Run the script** and capture ALL output
2. **Parse the output** - identify errors, warnings, and passes
3. **Summarize to user** in this format:

```markdown
## Script Results: [script_name.py]

### ❌ Errors Found (X items)
- [File:Line] Error description 1
- [File:Line] Error description 2

### ⚠️ Warnings (Y items)
- [File:Line] Warning description

### ✅ Passed (Z items)
- Check 1 passed
- Check 2 passed

**Should I fix the X errors?**
```

4. **Wait for user confirmation** before fixing
5. **After fixing** → Re-run script to confirm

> 🔴 **VIOLATION:** Running script and ignoring output = FAILED task.
> 🔴 **VIOLATION:** Auto-fixing without asking = Not allowed.
> 🔴 **Rule:** Always READ output → SUMMARIZE → ASK → then fix.



## OUTPUT FORMAT

- Return:
  - `Scope`
  - `Evidence`
  - `Findings`
  - `Artifacts`
  - `Next Actions`
- Name any generated files by exact path so the next reviewer does not have to rediscover them.

## Starter Commands

Run these first to capture the current workspace before applying the rest of the skill.

```bash
mkdir -p clean-code-output
pwd > clean-code-output/pwd.txt
rg --files . | head -200 > clean-code-output/repo-files.txt
git status --short > clean-code-output/git-status.txt 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Quick Mode (< 5 minutes)

- Start with the first scope or inventory command, not the whole workflow.
- Limit the first pass to one host, one file, one repo, or one artifact set.
- Stop after you have one saved artifact and a short findings draft.


## Troubleshooting / Fallback

- If the primary tool is missing, use the repo-local helper script or the simplest shell fallback already shown in the skill.
- If the target blocks, errors, or returns nothing, capture the raw error output and narrow the scope before retrying.
- If the dataset is too large, split by host, file, or time window before rerunning the skill.
- Edge case 1: the source format is custom or incomplete; save a sample and document the gap.
- Edge case 2: the work depends on a non-default port, path, or encoding; record it before rerunning commands.


## Phase Output Map

- Phase 1 output: a scoped starting artifact such as an inventory file, target file, or working directory.
- Phase 2 output: one or more evidence files captured from the main validation step.
- Phase 3 output: a short findings set or structured artifact ready for review or handoff.


## Done When

- Scope is fixed and written down.
- At least one reproducible artifact is saved.
- The next skill or teammate can continue without re-discovering context.



- Load the next narrower or downstream skill only after saving artifacts from this one.

## Technique Depth

### Technique 1: Artifact manifest and scope note
Use when you need a stable starting point before deeper clean-code review.
```bash
# Create the output directory for this skill
mkdir -p clean-code-output
# Save a full file manifest for the current workspace
find . -maxdepth 5 -type f | sort > clean-code-output/artifact-manifest.txt
# Start a short scope note so the reviewer records boundaries first
printf '%s
' 'scope:' 'assumptions:' 'owner:' > clean-code-output/scope-note.txt
```
- The artifact manifest is the baseline for every later finding.
- The scope note prevents the reviewer from silently widening the task.

### Technique 2: Hash and timestamp the first review set
Use when another reviewer may need to confirm they inspected the same files.
```bash
# Hash the first review set so the handoff can be reproduced
head -30 clean-code-output/artifact-manifest.txt | xargs -r sha256sum > clean-code-output/artifact-hashes.txt
# Save UTC and local timestamps for the review start
date -u > clean-code-output/review-start-utc.txt
date > clean-code-output/review-start-local.txt
```
- Hashes and timestamps make the first evidence slice reproducible.
- Keep UTC and local time together when the team works across time zones.

### Technique 3: Keyword-based signal hunt
Use when you need the first evidence slice without opening every file manually.
```bash
# Search for high-signal words in the current workspace
rg -n "error|warn|failed|denied|timeout|exception|secret|token|config" . > clean-code-output/signal-hits.txt 2>/dev/null || true
# Preview the first hits so the next step is explicit
sed -n '1,80p' clean-code-output/signal-hits.txt
# Count which files produced the most hits
cut -d: -f1 clean-code-output/signal-hits.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > clean-code-output/signal-hit-counts.txt 2>/dev/null || true
```
- This narrows the first review path quickly.
- The hit-count summary is often more useful than raw matches alone.

### Technique 4: Directory map and extension inventory
Use when the workspace layout is unfamiliar or inconsistent.
```bash
# Capture a short directory map
find . -maxdepth 3 -type d | sort > clean-code-output/directory-map.txt
# Capture a file-extension summary for the current tree
find . -maxdepth 5 -type f | sed 's|^.*/||' | awk -F. 'NF>1 {print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > clean-code-output/extension-summary.txt
# Review the top entries before opening files by hand
sed -n '1,40p' clean-code-output/extension-summary.txt
```
- The directory map tells a junior reviewer where to look first.
- Extension counts reveal whether the scope is mostly code, docs, logs, or artifacts.

### Technique 5: Git and workspace delta review
Use when code drift may explain the current state.
```bash
# Save git status and diff stats if the workspace is a repo
git status --short > clean-code-output/git-status.txt 2>/dev/null || true
git diff --stat > clean-code-output/git-diff-stat.txt 2>/dev/null || true
git log --oneline -n 20 > clean-code-output/git-log.txt 2>/dev/null || true
```
- A short git history often explains why a review target changed.
- Keep repo state beside findings so later reviewers see the same context.

### Technique 6: Structured notes and report starter
Use when you want report writing to begin from saved artifacts rather than memory.
```bash
# Create a report starter with the required sections
printf '%s
' '# Summary' '## Scope' '## Evidence' '## Findings' '## Next Actions' > clean-code-output/clean-code-report-starter.md
# Save a structured note file for reviewer observations
printf '%s
' 'observation:' 'confidence:' 'artifact:' 'next_step:' > clean-code-output/review-notes.txt
# Preview the report starter
sed -n '1,40p' clean-code-output/clean-code-report-starter.md
```
- Report drafting should start only after artifacts exist.
- Structured notes make the handoff cleaner and easier to verify.

### Technique 7: Output manifest and bundle preview
Use when another person will need the complete artifact set.
```bash
# Save an output manifest for everything produced by this skill
find clean-code-output -maxdepth 2 -type f | sort > clean-code-output/output-manifest.txt
# Build a compressed handoff bundle
tar -czf clean-code-output/clean-code-bundle.tgz clean-code-output 2>/dev/null || true
# Preview bundle contents for a quick QA pass
tar -tzf clean-code-output/clean-code-bundle.tgz | head -80 2>/dev/null || true
```
- The manifest becomes the handoff map for the next skill.
- The bundle makes the review portable without copying terminal history.

### Technique 8: Artifact ranking and review queue
Use when there are too many candidate files for a single pass.
```bash
# Count which files appear most often in the signal set
cut -d: -f1 clean-code-output/signal-hits.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > clean-code-output/review-queue.txt 2>/dev/null || true
# Save the top ranked entries for the next pass
sed -n '1,30p' clean-code-output/review-queue.txt > clean-code-output/review-queue-top.txt 2>/dev/null || true
# Preview the ranked queue
sed -n '1,30p' clean-code-output/review-queue-top.txt
```
- A ranked queue prevents random file selection.
- It also keeps the next step explicit for junior reviewers.

### Technique 9: Readable-file fallback inventory
Use when permissions or tool availability limit the happy path.
```bash
# Save only the readable files in the current tree
find . -maxdepth 4 -type f -readable | sort > clean-code-output/readable-files.txt
# Capture unreadable-path errors separately when possible
find . -maxdepth 4 -type f 2> clean-code-output/find-errors.txt >/dev/null || true
# Review the first readable entries
sed -n '1,50p' clean-code-output/readable-files.txt
```
- This keeps the workflow moving even with partial permissions.
- Save permission limits explicitly instead of treating them as absence of data.

### Technique 10: Finding sheet and final skeleton
Use when the skill is ready to hand off to reporting or a narrower review.
```bash
# Create a CSV finding sheet with stable columns
printf '%s
' 'item,severity,detail,artifact,next_step' > clean-code-output/clean-code-findings.csv
# Create a final markdown skeleton with explicit handoff
printf '%s
' '# Summary' '## Findings' '## Commands Used' '## Artifacts Produced' '## Next Steps' > clean-code-output/clean-code-final.md
# Preview the output files for QA
sed -n '1,20p' clean-code-output/clean-code-final.md
```
- The finding sheet keeps output machine-readable.
- The final markdown skeleton tells the next reviewer exactly what to expect.

## Decision Logic

- If the first inventory artifact already answers the question → stop and write the answer instead of widening scope.
- If the primary technique produces only noisy evidence → switch to a fallback that preserves artifacts rather than guessing.
- If permissions block the happy path → prefer config review, offline artifacts, or read-only files.
- If the work is limited to passive or lab-only scope → skip any technique that would mutate state or add traffic.
- If two evidence sources agree → increase confidence and keep both artifact paths in the report.
- If two evidence sources disagree → mark the finding unresolved and save both artifacts.
- If the current skill reveals a narrower follow-on task → save artifacts first, then load `systematic-debugging`.
- If filenames are generic or ambiguous → rename them with the skill prefix before moving on.
- If the reviewer cannot explain why a command was run → remove it from the narrative and keep only artifact-backed steps.
- If the report can be written from existing artifacts → stop collecting more data and finish the report.

## Fallback Techniques

### ถ้า `rg` is missing:
```bash
# Alternative: preserve evidence with the least risky available path
grep -RIn "error\|warn\|failed\|denied\|timeout\|exception\|secret\|token\|config" . > clean-code-output/signal-hits-grep.txt 2>/dev/null || true
```

### ถ้า `sha256sum` is missing:
```bash
# Alternative: use a portable SHA-256 command when available
shasum -a 256 clean-code-output/clean-code-bundle.tgz > clean-code-output/clean-code-bundle.shasum 2>/dev/null || true
```

### ถ้า `git` metadata is unavailable:
```bash
# Alternative: keep a plain file and directory snapshot instead of repo history
find . -maxdepth 4 -type f | sort > clean-code-output/workspace-files.txt
```

### ถ้า logs or source trees are too large:
```bash
# Alternative: review only the first ranked evidence slice
sed -n '1,100p' clean-code-output/review-queue.txt > clean-code-output/review-queue-slice.txt 2>/dev/null || true
```

### ถ้า permission is limited:
```bash
# Alternative: preserve the readable subset and note the boundary explicitly
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -readable | sort > clean-code-output/permission-limited-files.txt
```

## Quick Mode (< 5 นาที) — Expanded

- Use this when you have less than five minutes, need the first artifact fast, or only need enough evidence to pick the next skill.
- Keep scope to one app, one host, one artifact set, or one lab segment.
- Stop after one inventory artifact, one evidence artifact, and one explicit next action are saved.

```bash
# Minimal quick-pass artifact list
find clean-code-output -maxdepth 2 -type f | sort > clean-code-output/quick-artifacts.txt 2>/dev/null || true
# Minimal quick-pass timestamp
date -u > clean-code-output/quick-timestamp.txt
# Minimal quick-pass preview
sed -n '1,40p' clean-code-output/quick-artifacts.txt 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case: Read-only evidence set
สถานการณ์: the workspace can be inspected but cannot be modified or bundled freely.
วิธีจัดการ:
```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -readable | sort > clean-code-output/readonly-files.txt
```

### Edge Case: Very large workspace
สถานการณ์: the repo or evidence set is too large for a first-pass full review.
วิธีจัดการ:
```bash
rg --files . | head -500 > clean-code-output/first-500-files.txt
```

### Edge Case: Non-standard directory layout
สถานการณ์: important files are nested deeper than expected or split across unusual paths.
วิธีจัดการ:
```bash
find . -maxdepth 6 -type d | sort > clean-code-output/deep-directory-map.txt
```

### Edge Case: Missing git metadata
สถานการณ์: the workspace is a bundle, export, or copied evidence set instead of a live repo.
วิธีจัดการ:
```bash
find . -maxdepth 5 -type f | sort > clean-code-output/ungitted-manifest.txt
```

### Edge Case: Mixed time zones
สถานการณ์: logs, notes, or findings were collected across different systems and time zones.
วิธีจัดการ:
```bash
date -u > clean-code-output/current-utc.txt
```

## Tool Comparison

| tool | ข้อดี | ข้อเสีย | ใช้เมื่อ |
|---|---|---|---|
| rg | Fast recursive search with line numbers | May not be installed everywhere | First-pass keyword triage |
| grep -R | Universal fallback on most systems | Noisy on large trees | Fallback recursive search |
| find | Precise inventory and manifest generation | Needs more piping for summaries | Artifact mapping and file counts |

## Output Templates

- produce: `clean-code-output/clean-code-report.md`
- produce: `clean-code-output/output-manifest.txt`

structure:
```markdown
# Summary
## Scope
## Findings
| item | severity | detail | artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
## Commands Used
## Artifacts Produced
## Next Steps → load `systematic-debugging`
```

machine-readable skeleton:
```text
artifact|type|purpose|used_in_finding
```

## Evidence Checklist

- Save the first inventory artifact before deeper analysis.
- Keep UTC timestamps for the review start.
- Keep raw and normalized outputs separate.
- Hash the final bundle if another reviewer will use it.
- Name output files with the skill prefix.
- Record whether evidence came from live inspection, config review, or offline artifacts.
- Record whether permissions limited the review.
- Keep exact artifact paths in every finding.
- Remove unrelated files from the final bundle.
- Verify all generated files still exist before closing the task.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Expanding scope before the first inventory file is saved.
- Mixing lab-only and production evidence in one summary.
- Writing findings without exact artifact paths.
- Using generic names like `output.txt` or `report.md`.
- Treating missing permissions as proof that nothing exists.
- Keeping only screenshots without supporting raw text output.
- Forgetting time zone, host, package, or build context.
- Handing off without an artifact manifest.
- Reusing commands from another scope without renaming outputs.
- Deleting intermediate artifacts before the report is accepted.

## Verification Checklist

- Confirm `clean-code-output` contains the report, manifest, and at least one evidence artifact.
- Confirm every finding cites an exact artifact path.
- Confirm the next skill is named explicitly.
- Confirm at least one fallback path is documented.
- Confirm the report separates observations, unknowns, and next actions.
- Confirm filenames are unique and skill-prefixed.
- Confirm no placeholder text remains.
- Confirm the quick mode output still makes sense if the full workflow was not run.
- Confirm the report can be read without reopening the terminal transcript.
- Confirm artifacts are still present on disk before closing the task.

## Review Questions for Junior Analysts

- Which artifact did you trust first, and why?
- Which artifact contradicted your first assumption?
- Which fallback would you use if the main tool disappeared?
- Which file would you open next if you had only two more minutes?
- Which output file would you hand to the next reviewer first?
- Which step created the strongest evidence for your finding?
- Which environment assumption would change your conclusion?
- Which artifact proves ownership, scope, or lab context?
- Which output names would confuse another reviewer if left generic?
- What exact question should the next skill `systematic-debugging` answer?

## Handoff Data to Preserve

- Review start time in UTC.
- Output manifest path.
- Bundle hash path.
- Scope note path.
- First inventory file path.
- First high-signal evidence file path.
- Fallback artifact path if the happy path failed.
- The exact next skill name: `systematic-debugging`.

## Scope Traps

- Do not widen from one artifact set to a whole environment without writing the reason.
- Do not merge findings from different apps, hosts, or lab segments into one unlabeled statement.
- Do not treat guessed ownership as confirmed scope.
- Do not assume a path is production just because it looks important.
- Do not claim absence of evidence until the inventory step is complete.
- Do not discard contradictory artifacts; preserve and explain them.
- Do not skip naming the next skill or next owner.
- Do not finish until the bundle and manifest are readable by the next reviewer.


## Next: load the next specialized skill

- Load the next narrower or downstream skill only after saving artifacts from this one.
